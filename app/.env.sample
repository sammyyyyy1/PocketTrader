# Copy this file to `.env` and edit to change which DB the backend connects to.
# Default: connect to the production DB service named `db`.

# Set to `db` to use the production dataset (full card list)
# Set to `db_sample` to use the sample dataset (smaller card list + sample collections)
MYSQL_HOST=db

# Other DB connection settings are defined in docker-compose.yml (user/password/database).
# If you change them here, update docker-compose or the services that rely on those values.
